"Currently, billions of people around the world use smart phones. According from the blog entitled """"News Bytes Philippine’s"""" by Alcantara et al. (2016) they mentioned that Filipinos are greatly attached to their smart phones for changeable reasons – whether for communication, entertainment, or productivity and different uses, either conduct financial transactions or keep in touch with family, friends, and colleagues. Three in 10 Filipinos have smart phones today because of its function that helps to send and store personal, medical data, business communications, and even intimate conversations over phones that can ease the work of the users, and based on statistical percentages conducted by the author it stated that 79% of Filipinos have already checked their smart phones within 15 minutes of waking up and 40 million people are active on mobile social media users. But for the network to grow and thrive, users must continue to trust that the personal information must be secure and the user privacy protected. Generally, according to the same author as above, through conducting statistical counts of smart phone users between android and iPhones; majority of Philippine smart phone users use Android with a percentage of 81% because of attributed on how android is adaptable to cheaper phones.  Since privacy issues are common nowadays with news like fraud, identity stealing and other scamming practice. It is hard to trust the personal belonging that easy to other people. There’s always a good chance these days that when it is handed over a smart phone to other people, the owner of the smart phone tends to be worried about how easily they could go through the user’s personal data. More often, the owner of the smart phone end up changing preferences or even deleting information like contacts or messages.  The researchers were likely to adjust and look for alternatives that might offer some security in terms of personal information. There are some applications on the market like safe gallery, folder lock, and more which offers password for user messages of even user gallery but these applications still has limitations. The borrower of the phone might still check some of the personal space on the owner’s phone like phonebook and notes. Given the current need for security and privacy, researchers proposed a system that aimed to address the above issues and concerns over security of mobile phone users. It is a development from current application release from the market with features improved. This aims to heighten the security of the phone intended for guest use. Security is most needed by many devices because this enables the system to protect and manage private information. On common problems present in the Philippines, according to an article written by Bartolome (2014), it mentioned that the press release from the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP ACG), a total of 1,211 cybercrime complaints were filed to them from 2013-2015. The top five complaints received were online scams (366), online libel (240), online threats (129), identity theft (127), and photo and video voyeurism (89). This is the reason why today mobile security is important in every users, since there are 44 million users in the Philippines using smart phones said by the PNP ACG as of 2014. The users spend an average of 18.6 hours per week (around 2.6 hours per day) online. That can result to unavoidable meddling to other’s businesses. The PNP ACG also released a list of Do’s that users need to keep in mind while they are using smart phones to avoid being victimized which is to set the privacy settings to the most secure setting available and make a unique password for every information. As of today, most of the companies in the business industry, system in education, in healthcare and government even individuals are against threats for a better and safer collection of information. While having security, it is more effective when it has an encryption tool as stated by Schulz and Hoboken (2015) on the article entitled """"Human Rights and Encryption"""" is stated that encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security even it is an old technique. Until today, it is still the best protecting associate when it comes to security issues; to read an encrypted file, a user must have access to a secret key or password that enables user to decrypt it. Unencrypted data is called plain text. On the other hand, encrypted data is referred to as cipher text. However, Encrypting is a necessary process so, the risk of spreading or even losing the important file can be prevented. It is necessary to secure the multimedia files and document files of smartphones because most of people’s personal and latest multimedia files are saved on their smartphones. Aside from preventing the multimedia file to be hacked by anyone, encryption of multimedia file is also important because this assures the android user that the multimedia files and document files are secure from unauthorized viewing caused by deletion and recovery of files, sabotage, and theft. Encryption of multimedia files and document files make sure that multimedia files and document files would not easily be deleted, corrupted, modified and spreading would be prevented because only the authorized user could do these processes. It is safe from disruption because even if the encrypted file was deleted already then recovered, the file will still be encrypted. Hence, encryption of multimedia files is a direct process for android users because this secures its file and prevents unauthorized viewing caused by intentional or mostly unintentional loss of data. The researchers aim to provide more security in terms of not limiting protection commonly offered on photos and messages of the phones. Personal data will be more secured and less troublesome on the owner for guest uses.","mobile security, data privacy, encryption, authentication"
"We are now living in the 21th century, the century were technology plays an important role in every industry as well as in our personal lives. Technology affects the way individuals communicate, learn and think. It also affects an individual’s work and leisure activities. It helps define society and determines how one interacts with others on a daily basis. The technological growth taking place in the world today is doing so very rapidly with new advancements being made with each passing day. Technology is making the multitask functions to be available in a single device. Thus, we can have multifunctional usage of the single device we own.
Out of all the industries that technology plays a crucial role in, healthcare is definitely one of the most important. Technological innovations in the healthcare industry continue to provide physicians with new ways to improve the quality of care delivered to their patients and improve the state of global healthcare. Through technology’s integration with areas like disease prevention, surgical procedures, better access to information, and medical telecommunications, the medical industry and patients around the world continue to benefit. Hospital Information Systems provide a common source of information about a patient’s health history. The system have to keep data in secure place and controls who can reach the data in certain circumstances. These systems enhance the ability of health care professionals to coordinate care by providing a patient’s health information and visit history at the place and time that it is needed. It may control organizations, which is Hospital in these case, official documentations, financial situation reports, personal data, utilities and stock amounts, also keeps in secure place patients information, patients medical history and prescriptions. Ever since JTSH (Jesus the Saviour Hospital) was built, they have been using manual procedures to gather, storing and updating the records of their patients. The developers of this study, after conducting a thorough analysis, have found out that JTSH (Jesus the Saviour Hospital) is in need of computerized system that would help to improve their day-to-day operations. For this reason, the developers would develop the entitled “Jesus the Saviour Hospital Management Information System”.","technology, healthcare, system"
"Technology has been an immense basic in today’s world. It has been utilized as a part of various viewpoints and condition. Technology refers to advancements in the methods and tools we use to solve problems or achieve a goal. Technology is widely used in different sectors in lives like in offices, homes and most especially in schools. They make it part of their everyday life and sees a chance to utilize it in each conceivable way possible. Examination is the basis of the evaluation of knowledge transfer from the teacher to the students. In the Philippines, examination is done traditionally with the use of pen and paper. As discussed by Isberto (2015) the head of Public Affairs at Smart Communication, every generation, teachers have always allotted extra effort and time needed for checking their students’ test papers. Teachers have to give a substantial amount of their time going through each test paper. He also mentioned that a teacher with a class of 40 students would need 400 minutes or a little less than seven hours to finish the task, assuming it will take him just 10 minutes to go through each test paper. Longer examinations would require longer hours for checking. He also discussed the Smart Image application developed by Capistrano et al. (2015) from Bulacan State University (BSU) on their study entitled “Image Processing based multiple-option examination checker”, that allows the hassle-free checking of test papers and it will make much easier for them to do that task, giving them more time to interact with students or bond with their families. An article discussed by Gregorio (2012) discussed that Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) is a process for the detection and recognition of marks written on paper that is often employed for the recognition of the answers checked in multiple choice tests. It is a system that analyzes digital images representing scans of multiple-choice tests compiled by students to avoid mistakes in manual process and allot of errors in counting he used Optical Mark Recognition to develop an image processing based optical mark recognition sheet scanning system. The system OMR answer sheet will be scan and the scanned image of the answer sheet will give as input to the software system. Some existing applications used Optical Mark Recognition for scanning bubble sheet type of examination. Since it is one of the most common method in having an examination it is useful that there are existing applications that can used to check those examination papers and to lessen the expensive scanners. Checking a student’s examination paper and analyzing results remain intricate and time consuming processes. An average of 95% of teachers grade their students’ tests manually and while many teachers still use separate works to grade tests, those services can take more time and effort than necessary. Unfortunately, testing and grading manually consume too much time. While every type of testing carries challenges, schools today have clearly reached the point where additional efficiency is needed. Teachers need to be able have the time to actually teach and need to find ways to do that while still dealing with severe budget challenges. Given the situation above, the researchers came up to develop a mobile application that has specific algorithm that give faster result and will not cost too much because it only used a mobile phones. This study aims to develop a mobile application that will help the teachers to lessen their work and give the examination result quickly to the students.","paperless, image processing, application"
"Information Technology has evolved for decades, it has provided the people with ease in doing tasks and numerous advantages in this modern world. Education has been the great beneficiary of this this technological revolution. Graduates are expected to possess skills both on their field and computer competencies. The large growing scale of graduates per academic year in the field of Hotel and Management and at the same time, the increasing number of employee in restaurants, hotels and other human resource fields of work. For employees with a small amount of knowledge and skills in Hotel Reservation Management gives them a low possibility of being hired in a prestigious hotels and restaurants due to computer technical skills. The emergent components of computer-aided instruction including multimedia presentations and interactive digital books are often developed separately to be used as individual approaches in Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) without a cohesive and comprehensive strategy. The key to effective CAI in the future lies in an integration of these three technologies to form a unified approach to education. An integrated approach will give students a comprehensive learning about hotel reservation management system that includes in-class, independent, and extended learning.","multi-media, AI, computer"
