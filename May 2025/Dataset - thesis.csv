CLASS SCHEDULER: AN EXPERT SYSTEM TIMETABLING FOR CCS FACULTY MEMBERS USING GENETIC ALGORITHM,"Technology grows as develop, creative innovations also grow. These changes make people’s lives more convenient. In earlier days, time table scheduling was done manually with a single person or some group involved in task of scheduling it manually, which takes a lot of effort and time. The problem with doing it manually is that as the number of variables increases, the complexity and difficulty of the tasks grows exponentially. It becomes very tedious and time consuming as the person has to remember and manage all the constraints. The other major problem is the human bias. A human may make a biased time table which favor some and is against other. It is prone to human errors which can come up because of lack of human attention. In this regard, the researcher aimed to developed a drag and drop scheduler to ease the task and lessen the time of how someone can make a schedule.

RFVMS: RADIO FREQUENCY VEHICLE MONITORING SYSTEM; A MODERNIZATION PROJECT,"Technology deals with the creation and use of technical means and interrelation with life, society and environment. With the advance of globalization, transportation is playing an important role. As transportation increases, many vehicles are involved in the transportation of one assignment from one location to another. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is often presented as replacement for today’s barcodes, but the technology has much greater possibilities, such as individual serial numbers for each item and the possibility to read these numbers at a distance of several meters. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a generic term that is used to describe a system that transmits the identity (in the form of a unique serial number) of an object or person wirelessly, using radio waves. It’s grouped under the broad category of automatic identification technologies. A typical RFID tag consists of a microchip attached to a radio antenna mounted on a substrate. The chip can store as much as 2 kilobytes of data. For example, information about a product or a shipment date of manufacture destination and sell by date can be written to a tag. A typical reader is a device that has one or more antennas that emit radio waves and receive signals back from the tag. The reader passes the information in digital form to a computer system. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an automatic identification method, relying on storing and remotely retrieving data using devices called RFID tags or transponders. The technology requires the cooperation of an RFID reader and an RFID tag. An RFID tag is an object that can be applied into an object for purpose of identification and tracking. This can be done using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader Radio Frequency Identification or RFID is an emerging technology that uses wireless radio waves to identify objects from a distance. RFID enables the user to capture real – time information in fast moving and bulky product flows with the aim of achieving a high degree of efficiency and assuring high quality. The RFID tag is the identification device attached to the item to be tracked. The RFID reader and antenna are devices that can recognize the presence of RFID tags and read the information stored on them. (A journal entitled “Vehicle Tracking Using RFID”, 2016)."

E-DOC: LSPU DOCUMENT TRACKING AND SCHEDULING SYSTEM WITH SMS NOTIFICATION,"Technology has proven to benefit human experience and achievement in many ways and has become a growing aspect of visitor engagement, documentation, and research in museums. Today’s businesses are up against more challenges than ever in the past. With technology having such a massive influence on just about every aspect of modern-day business, organizations in just about every industry struggle with how to best approach the workday. One of the biggest effects that modern technology has had on business operations revolve. Over the years, paper is still an important information carrier, even in our more and more electronically penetrated environment. Every day we use paper documents in our office, even when electronic versions of the documents are available. Instead of replacing the paper completely as developed by the myth of the paperless office, new ways for better integrating paper into our daily work are needed. For this reason, new ways are required for the handling of paper documents, integrating them to one’s best in our workflow instead of substituting them. Documents come in the form of both paper and electronic. For ages, businesses have been following a paper-based document management model. However, technology for document processing has been mostly limited to better and faster ways to generate, print, and transport text documents. Now several trends and developments suggest that we are on the verge of a major advance in computer based information management. Document management focuses on the organization of documents to support active work in progress, including content creation and sharing within an organization. When organizations do not have any kind of formal document management system in place, content is often created and saved in an unmanaged and decentralized way on scattered file shares. This process is amazingly time consuming and too often ignored."
