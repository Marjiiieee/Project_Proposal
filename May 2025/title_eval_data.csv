"Technology and communication are two of the most common things in the world today especially now that we are entering a fast modernization process. While communication is necessary in every relation, technology makes messages or information delivered at the right time with the right content. Whether it is in social media or mass media, the transfer of communication has brought great importance to schools, businesses and other establishments. For an individual belonging to a certain establishment, it would be advantageous to know all the updates, upcoming events, important announcements and all the latest news around you. The use of the internet and social media has become a solution to it but this was not the case all the time. One can either get false information from an invalid source or a made up announcement. This study is about the creation of the CCS InfoCast, an official announcement system for an establishment, particularly in a school, that will erase all doubts about the validity and reliability of information that one is receiving. This will serve as an efficient and effective way to receive important announcements without delay. It is designed to send information to cell phones which is more convenient to both to the recipients and the senders. This will also help clear confusions during emergencies, update people about the future events and will make communication easier and faster which is necessary in real life. Since we are under the reality that communication and technology are conjoined necessities of life, and since communication via different means like the social media are not generally reliable and timely, the researchers came up with the idea of making announcement and information dissemination possible without delay and with validity through an SMS-based announcement system that is controllable by the sender. This system project is particularly for the College of Computer Studies (CCS) of LSPU (Laguna State Polytechnic University) Sta. Cruz Campus which now certainly is in need of the said proposed technology.",CCS INFOCAST: AN INFORMATION DISSEMINATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING SMS BLAST
"Heat comes from the temperature of matter and it is used in different things and activities like cooking, warming the surroundings, generating electricity, drying clothes, plants food-making process, purifying water and etc. Heat is one of the most used energy that is being used and also the one of the most wasted energy. The traditional way of cooking food in a rotisserie grill produces heat and uses electricity at the same time which is not very economical. The lack of energy recycling produces a lot waste energy from only using heat. An example of stores that uses rotisserie grill is Andok’s Litson-Manok, Sr. Pedro Lechon Manok, Baliwag Lechon Manok and Bounty Fresh Chicken Chooks – to – GO. These stores are some of the biggest culprits when it comes to wasting heat energy. Running a machine uses a lot of electricity for long can increase the electricity bill. The expenses might increase which forces the price of a product to increase and might reduce the sales. Thermoelectricity, also called Peltier-Seebeck effect, direct conversion of heat into electricity or electricity into heaist through two related mechanisms, the Seebeck effect and the Peltier effect. The researchers came up with an idea that could eliminate wasting energy and at the same time producing electricity by applying a thermoelectric effect to the rotisserie grill. The objective of the researchers is to seek for solution on conserving the energy that is being wasted that will be efficient and effective when cooking. The project will be beneficial to the owner of specific stores that uses rotisserie machine.",THERMOELECTRIC BBQ GRILL
"In these times, various ways of cooling and preserving foods and beverages are becoming in demand to people. There are two popular among the existing and available ways of cooling and preserving foods and drinks in market today. First is the device use indoor which is called refrigerator; and the second one is call cooler use when performing activities outdoor. Each home, country mostly have refrigerators at home as we use it to keep food cold/preserve it and keeping it away from bacterial growth as well as to keep it safe until we eat it. If you think about it, living without appliances like this can be very difficult: but refrigerators are not always just good. There are actually disadvantages out from owning one. Most of us would think that it would be better to have those problems than have no refrigerators at all: but there are facts you should know and take into consideration about it. One of the biggest disadvantages that this appliance can give you is the cost of keeping it on. It takes about one sixth of the electricity that you use at home along with freezer. It is even more worse that when your parents are still starting to use the earlier model plus the cost of running the fridge will increase power consumption which increases the electric bill. The other cooling device which is known as the cooler, is a portable ice chest, ice box, cool box, chilly bin (in New Zealand) or Esky (Australia). Most commonly is an insulated box use in keeping food or drink cool. Like refrigerators, coolers have noticeable disadvantage that users did not realize on the time of using this cooling device. Ice cubes are most commonly place in it to help the things inside cool. Ice packs are sometimes use, as they either contain the melting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that stays cold longer than plain ice (absorbing heat as it changes phase). It is normally use when performing outdoor activities such as picnics, gatherings, reunions, and the like. This requires lot of ice or ice cubes in order for the drinks to be cooled and maintain to be cooled. Furthermore, the cooling ability of a cooler is not reliable because it depends upon the quantity or amount of the ice inside it. Using refrigerators to preserve food and beverages, Cooler when performing activities outdoor has been the conventional way for people. But because of the drawback seen, cite, and deliberate by the researchers upon using refrigerator and cooler to preserve foods and beverages. Therefore, the researchers got an idea to combine the idea of the refrigerator and the concept of a cooler as one to a device which will fulfill the lacks of the said cooling devices before to a more efficient, effective, environmental friendly, practical and convenient cooling device.The researchers are seeking to make a device that will help people. They decide to invent a device that has the ability to maintain coldness and preserving of foods.The thermoelectric cooler or Peltier plate, have a two (2) side. Each side has its own temperature. The one we will use is the cold side. We will use it so we can have to maintain coldness of some beverages and prevent spoiling of foods until we eat it. The other side is hot side. We will put a heat sink to pumps out the heat out and the cooling fan will throw the heat outside.",PORTABLE COOLER
"People nowadays are living in an information age dependent upon digital and the same time the number of work of the faculty members in recording the grades of the students consume time and effort delivering it to a new version of Online Grading system the Admin capable to monitor the class record of the students. . Technology is significant because it is constantly changing the demands of every individual. The new innovations are still under technology which contributes a lot and which became part of our daily lives. Technologies grew exponentially and spawned new and emerging technologies that have diffused rapidly throughout all sectors of the economy. The rapid innovation in technology specifically on computers, invades most of the work of man today. Unlike before modern technology dramatically changed the way we live and how we do business. Computer equipment was relatively expensive in these early days ,these systems were among the easier to create, small savings in the costs to process large numbers of transactions added up to significant amounts that would cover the costs of the expensive equipment, and few other business processes within typical organizations could provide these benefits. In order to provide an efficient and useful online grading System the researchers gathered vital information needed in advancing to develop the system. Many teachers feel that they take in recording and computing for the grades of their students is time that could be better spent elsewhere, like preparing lessons, researching or meeting with their students. With the advent of computer technology, more and more schools are taking advantage of a variety of grading systems available both off-line and online that can help save time on administrative tasks and give teachers more time to attend other important functions. However, a greater majority, especially small schools, government schools, and schools in remote areas, still utilize the manual method of recording and computing for the grades of the students.",CCS ONLINE GRADING SYSTEM
"In our fast-changing society, technology is making a huge innovation in almost everything. People nowadays are always updated most specially with the latest trend of technology that will make their living easier and comfortable. One of the roots of this gigantic change in our generation are computers. Computers have already renovated our lives through communicating, working, learning things and even the simplest routine that we do every day. Fortunately, computers serves a very important role to everyone including students, computers help students not only by means of pleasure and entertainment but most especially on their study. Students of this generation are more into easy and fast way of learning. In that case, they need various and innovative ways of gathering information and reference tools that could help in their studies. Libraries are one of the most known and equipped place to go for information and reference, usually for study and education purpose. Not all libraries can provide all the books that the students need, in accordance to this, they provide technological materials that can aid the need for the missing or incomplete references and information. This technology includes electronic sources such as electronic journals, multimedia content and electronic books. Nowadays, people live in a modernized world. Modernization is now a big part of the industry, economy, and even in education. One of this is digitization. Digitizing is the art of converting the contents of a document from hard copy into machine-readable format. It makes the materials easy to access and available electronically, it also serves a purpose of preserving the material. Any type of information can be represented in digital form, such as pictures, musical works, text, computer programs, databases, models and designs, video programs, and any other works combining many types of information. A person that is need of information can easily click, type and search for the information needed in just a matter of seconds. It does not only made searching and information gathering easy but also it saves a lot of time and effort not only for students and teachers but for everyone who’s in need. The Researchers created the Online Thesis Management System of the Laguna State Polytechnic University, College of Computer Studies, to provide them the information and references needed for researching. It is made exclusively for CCS students and made accessible through student identification number. It will serves as a reference guide for the students who will make their own thesis. Research coordinators will be the one to monitor every student who are conducting their research through the use of a single computer unit. The students will just do some typing and clicking then search for the specific information they need effortless while saving their time.",CCS ONLINE THESIS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
"The technology is widely implemented in today's modern world. It continuously spreads and changes every time. And as the technology innovates, many of us rely on it. It affects the works of everyone in everyday lives, making the work easier and faster. Because of that, many things are done better. One of the best example of technology is a computer. It is an electronic machine that can store and handle large amounts of information. Communication, entertainment and providing information are examples of how a computer works. Exchanging of information allow people to communicate with one another in the country and outside of it. By simply means of that, it stays the world connected by each other. Technology altered the way people do their jobs in companies and even in schools. One of the reason why, is the efficiency of the technology used. Using preferred systems in the computer, an organization helps to manage their files that control limitless of actions depends on how they created it. In school, portfolio of faculties are being implemented. Portfolio is composed of different documents, likes Certificates, Seminars Attended, Resume, Teaching Philosophy, Individual Faculty Development Plan, and are presented together in a folder. Keeping managed documents can easily track a certain file whether it is alphabetically in order, by category or what so ever kind of sort they did. As described from Walton (2015), in her study “Faculty Information System”, the University's system provides faculty with a secure, Web-based resource for creating annual reviews, online profiles, and other documents important to academic careers. It allows researchers to create an NIH Biographical Sketch and generate a report that can be used during the performance review process. Faculty can also search the system by research interests and/or publication topics to identify faculty with particular expertise and interests.  The Faculty Information System of the University of Pittsburgh requires an account to access the system.",EFORT AN ELECTRONIC FACULTY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
"Technology gives so much impact in our society in a very big way. Nowadays it is almost expected of everyone to have a computers or the Internet. If take a look back a few years ago, not everyone had all of these new technologies or devices. Before, people are dependent on the things that are manually used. And because of continue  hanging in technology, everything is becoming easier and more accurate works. Most institutions especially schools are using computerized system to lessen the paper works and give accurate and effective results. Based on the study, when students are using technology as a tool or a support for communicating with others, they are in an active role rather than the passive role of recipient of information transmitted by a teacher, textbook, or broadcast. The student is actively making choices about how to generate, obtain, manipulate, or display information. In connection to these, we recognize the used of computerized systems and one of those is the FEMS: a LAN-Based Students Evaluation on Faculty Performance. Nowadays, many companies and organizations evaluate their staffs based on their performance and achievement. Evaluations are important information about the results of department cooperation and for political decision-makers. Evaluation is important in order to contribute and improve development effectiveness, accountability of staffs, organizational learning, and improves decision-making. Over 30 years old, evaluations in education program have expanded over the world. The Elementary and Secondary Education ACT (ESEA) in 1965 represented the compelling examples of the failure of federally mandated evaluations to improve educational policy and practice (McLaughlin, 1975). There are many goals and purpose for evaluation teachers. In Mexico, a Highly Objective Uniform Statewide Standard of Evaluation (HOUSSE) identify the purpose of evaluation is to assist in identifying and building upon teacher strengths, to address accountability and teacher quality and to serve as the basis for the improvement of instruction (Ball, 2005). Another purpose is to use all the information and effectiveness to upgrading school and with the comparison of evaluation it will encourage schools to improve their performance (McLaughlin, 1975). The Jackson Public School District has developed a performance evaluation system for teachers, and this system recognizes the need for orienting, inducting, and evaluating new employees or employees new to a position, evaluating employees who are experienced in their position, and offering professional growth options for commendable teachers who deserve an array of choices in meeting evaluation and growth goals. According to Joan (2011) the main problem that most of the evaluation systems has is the validity of result Evidence of validity must be accumulated to supported interfaces made from evaluation results. Wise and other (1984), define to made a successful evaluation methods which used must be reliable, effective and efficient. For reliability, an evaluation must give similar scores or ranking for similar tests regardless who is evaluator or evaluated. Effectiveness implies the evaluation provides result in their useful format. There are many methods can use for this evaluation such as faculty selfevaluation, and classroom evaluation. The researcher aims to create better evaluation system “FEMS: A LANBased Students Evaluation on Faculty Performance” that meets the needs of College of Computer Studies. It lessens the problems in terms of evaluating professor’s performance. The idea is to make a LAN-based system that will eliminate the manual process. It provide a transparent and consistent teacher evaluation system that ensures effective teaching and promotes professional learning.","""FEMS: A LAN-BASED STUDENTS EVALUATION ON FACULTY PERFORMANCE"" FACULTY PERFORMANCE"
"Most believe that technology made our lives easier, more comfortable, enabled us to perform tasks that we could not do otherwise and improved the world for the better in many ways, where one could the list boundless benefits of it. From ancient time to the present generation great number of technological innovations are invented, from the very first wheel to compass, printing press, engines, electricity, telephone, aircraft, and other significant inventions. One of the features for a certain innovation to be in trend is its versatility, and example of this are the computer and the mobile phone wherein in the technology field it is considered a success and still used at the present time.Computer and mobile phones are one of the innovations that has a very strong impact not just on technology but on the lives of people. Since we are in the information age, almost everything we do and need relies on the computer along with the internet. Both are very beneficial whether in comes to science, business, health, and others, especially in the field of education. In the field of education, it is a great source and tool in teaching, learning, researching, information resource, guidance purposes, presentations, and communication. Computer along with internet is also being utilized in education where most of the schools and universities today have their own website that contains information about them, what they offer, their field of specialties, announcements and others. On the other hand, mobile phones are presently considered a necessity lining up with food, shelter and clothing rather than luxury. It revolutionized the world of communication, where one can communicate no matter what time and where he is with just a press or click away, connecting people from different parts of the world. One of its features is the SMS or Short Message Service wherein it is still comparatively the best and easiest way to reach a person. Also, according to Ling(2000), SMS application is hooked to the individual irrespective of time and place that the SMS service is at its highest when it can be used anywhere, anytime and without being restricted by borders whereby anybody can freely send and receive information. To add to that, the United Kingdom's second biggest-selling daily newspaper, the Daily Mail (2014), wrote in their article that in a certain study, sending text messages and receiving messages are the top two major functions most people uses a mobile phone for. We are in the era where technology in which both computer and mobile phone that has the SMS feature combined when utilized is a great tool in disseminating information since traditionally, notice boards, verbal broadcast and other traditional announcement medium are still being used, the researchers decided to make the Web-based Announcement System via SMS exclusively for the College of Computer Studies of Laguna Polytechnic University to introduce a fast and convenient way of communication. The system will deliver information about the latest updates of events and announcements and it will be notified through SMS of the said college.",I-ANNOUNCE: A WEB-BASED ANNOUNCEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM VIA SMS FOR THE COLLEGE OF COMPUTER STUDIES
"We are now living in the 21th century, the century were technology plays an important role in every industry as well as in our personal lives. Technology affects the way individuals communicate, learn and think. It also affects an individual’s work and leisure activities. It helps define society and determines how one interacts with others on a daily basis. The technological growth taking place in the world today is doing so very rapidly with new advancements being made with each passing day. Technology is making the multitask functions to be available in a single device. Thus, we can have multifunctional usage of the single device we own.
Out of all the industries that technology plays a crucial role in, healthcare is definitely one of the most important. Technological innovations in the healthcare industry continue to provide physicians with new ways to improve the quality of care delivered to their patients and improve the state of global healthcare. Through technology’s integration with areas like disease prevention, surgical procedures, better access to information, and medical telecommunications, the medical industry and patients around the world continue to benefit. Hospital Information Systems provide a common source of information about a patient’s health history. The system have to keep data in secure place and controls who can reach the data in certain circumstances. These systems enhance the ability of health care professionals to coordinate care by providing a patient’s health information and visit history at the place and time that it is needed. It may control organizations, which is Hospital in these case, official documentations, financial situation reports, personal data, utilities and stock amounts, also keeps in secure place patients information, patients medical history and prescriptions. Ever since JTSH (Jesus the Saviour Hospital) was built, they have been using manual procedures to gather, storing and updating the records of their patients. The developers of this study, after conducting a thorough analysis, have found out that JTSH (Jesus the Saviour Hospital) is in need of computerized system that would help to improve their day-to-day operations. For this reason, the developers would develop the entitled “Jesus the Saviour Hospital Management Information System”.",JESUS THE SAVIOUR HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
"As modern technology steps forward, the amount on information is said to be expanding that indicates to formulate new ways of thinking, working and living. Technology helps us in all aspects of our everyday life and the most useful to our work that offers a better way of living. Computer is one of the products of modern technology which helps human in processing the information for such different purposes. It also offers fast searching and retrieval of information needed and a better working environment in the office. A computer is really a remarkable machine that allows people to do many different tasks in a convenient way. It provides information and a way of communication for every individual. It also gives a better understanding for some event that may take place the interest to some particular subject. Universities like Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU) – College of Computer Studies (CCS) still uses manual processing of payment for some college events. Since the CCS handles large number of transactions per semester, some problems arises which cause delays to some extent. LSPU CCS Payment Transaction Management System proved that computer can be very useful to solve a problem that arises from the increasing population of the students every year. This system is an offline application that will help the Dean’s office of the CCS in making their to tasks faster so that there will be no checking of transaction manually, they just need to type the names that are needed to finish a transaction, they don’t have to manually write the needed information. The system also offer faster transaction in payment and provides accurate reports, it minimized the time and effort exerted by both students and the faculty. This study was very beneficial for the CCS because the system minimized the effort of the college’s secretary in computation of transactions and the paper works done to compile their everyday reports. It also convenient to both students and CCS faculty.",LSPU CCS PAYMENT TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
"Over the years, paper documents have been problematic because of its disadvantage of being difficult to store and track. Most organizations are moving away from paper documents and now going to digital forms. Through the document management system, it is now possible to manage tons of documents especially on a large organizations. It may now considered as one of the most valuable assets an organization can possess. Information Technology comes in different roles and/or uses. There many inventions and discoveries using IT. Information Technology can be used on business, like in marketing, banks, department stores, document management and many more. IT is really dominating the world. One of the uses of Information Technology is the document management system. Document management system provide an easier way of sorting, editing and tracking or searching documents. It also provides a great way to organized all the documents and transform it into digital forms. It also become a trend on large business. Some of the emerging trends in document management system are DMS through the cloud, where the user can easily access the documents but it has risk in security and DMS using mobile devices. The other is DMS using mobile device, because everything is going mobile, most DMS are now can possibly access though a mobile device. Most of all DMS focuses on security. Volumes of documents are being processed and stored in the system that’s why security is the main focus of the system. The researchers proposed project will probably contribute and benefit the IT society. It will help the College of Computer Studies to have not only a backup of their hard copy documents but also have a security to every confidential document the CCS has.

"The syllabus is important to educators because it provides a planning and communication tool with which to set realistic expectations for you and your students, it organizes a professor’s thoughts to the subject, and it helps you and your students to stay focused on the course objectives and exit outcomes. Its main importance to the educational institution is that it provides the ones who educate a map or pattern on how they shall deliver certain subject to every student they handle. Nowadays, a course syllabus is used by high school teachers and college instructors for a variety of reasons. In order to create an effective syllabus, a teacher or an instructor must first establish his or her course learning outcomes, consider what the students need to learn in that course and provide course information such as course code, prerequisites and other requirements. They can also consult the syllabus template provided by the school and at the same time consider the concerns of students about the course. The syllabus is also a helpful tool on the part of a teacher in communicating with the students. It presents a thorough step by step pattern in the comprehensive teaching of a certain subject. The world of Information Technology or IT at present uses computers and telecommunications equipment to store, transmit and manipulate data. In the past; however, a syllabus is stored in file cabinets as hard copies. Today, college instructors are privileged to easily avail of the use of Microsoft Word in creating, editing, saving and printing of a syllabus.

However, data overload has been one of the dilemmas the organization encounter consequently shortage of information has become one the problems of the business firms hence they recognize that it is a vital resource of a company. Over the decades, information has become a strategic asset of an organization. Companies spend thousands of money to invest in Information Technology. From different organization such as educational institution and business firms, organizations recognizes the significance of valuable and quality information. These quality information is transformed into a knowledge which is significant to decision making. Decision support systems (DSS) has been a rampant trend in many organizations. Rouse (2016) defined Decision Support System (DSS) as a computer program application that analyzes business data and draw knowledge or organization. A decision support system may present information graphically and may include an expert system or artificial intelligence (AI). It may be aimed at business executives or some other group of knowledge workers. Collectively it has become a necessity for decision makers. Its prediction and recommendation capability makes it important to decision makers. Loan offering companies especially banks most especially take advantage of this technology specifically risk analysis for debtors. In the Philippines, one of the fast growing industry are real estate companies dominating the market for over 20 years. Realty Company that provide low-cost housing has positioned their organizations in the top of the game.

"Technology is very essential in people’s lives. It is a big advantage in almost everything people do to complete our tasks effortlessly in a lesser time. Everywhere people go and anything they do, technology does exist. It helps a user in the different ways like in school, business, communication, healthcare, entertainment and even inside their house. The capability of technology in helping people to ease task is a big necessity and has a huge contribution on improving the way of living, discovering many things, capability to solve big problems and opening new opportunities. Document scanning is needed by people to process their hard copy documents on replicating through the use of “scanner” which is a personal computer peripheral for digitizing images or documents. It lessens the time of copying image or text and turns it into a digital file. The users tend to waiting in front of a machine to take a physical piece of paper and make it digital. In connection to the above paragraph, Thibodeaux (2017) a freelance writer and editor based in Eagan, Minnesota, said that there are some disadvantages on converting scanned documents. Those disadvantages can affect the quality of the output because of some limitations. One limitation it has is that scanners need to be maintained for a better quality of scanning. The bulbs inside the scanner needs to be changed when it gets dim or gets old. The whole scanner needs to be replaced overtime and the accessories inside it when it is already outdated. Also, the scanner bed can become dirty, in which a single piece of dust can contribute to dots, lines and other pieces of unwanted design that shows up on scans. When found it, these can be difficult when a user tries to remove it. These disadvantages can be prevented with the use of software with an algorithm that has the capability of enhancing the quality of a captured hard copy document. One of them is through image processing. Even though the scanner bed can become dirty, that causes dots and lines the software will process the scanned document through the personal computer which it can only recognize the text and the unwanted dots or lines will be removed. Most of the file scanning devices are using software that has an OCR Algorithm which stands for Optical Character Recognition Algorithm. OCR Algorithm is a technology that converts images of typed, whether it is a photo of a document or pictures with a text that can be readable by the users and the computer. It is a common method of digitizing printed texts. During the conversion, the characters from the document are being analyzed so that they can be electronically edited. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision (Optical Character Recognition 1993).",AFSCAN: ANDROID FILE SCANNER AND TRANSLATOR WITH OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITIONAFSCAN: ANDROID FILE SCANNER AND TRANSLATOR WITH OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION
"Currently, billions of people around the world use smart phones. According from the blog entitled """"News Bytes Philippine’s"""" by Alcantara et al. (2016) they mentioned that Filipinos are greatly attached to their smart phones for changeable reasons – whether for communication, entertainment, or productivity and different uses, either conduct financial transactions or keep in touch with family, friends, and colleagues. Three in 10 Filipinos have smart phones today because of its function that helps to send and store personal, medical data, business communications, and even intimate conversations over phones that can ease the work of the users, and based on statistical percentages conducted by the author it stated that 79% of Filipinos have already checked their smart phones within 15 minutes of waking up and 40 million people are active on mobile social media users. But for the network to grow and thrive, users must continue to trust that the personal information must be secure and the user privacy protected. Generally, according to the same author as above, through conducting statistical counts of smart phone users between android and iPhones; majority of Philippine smart phone users use Android with a percentage of 81% because of attributed on how android is adaptable to cheaper phones.  Since privacy issues are common nowadays with news like fraud, identity stealing and other scamming practice. It is hard to trust the personal belonging that easy to other people. There’s always a good chance these days that when it is handed over a smart phone to other people, the owner of the smart phone tends to be worried about how easily they could go through the user’s personal data. More often, the owner of the smart phone end up changing preferences or even deleting information like contacts or messages.  The researchers were likely to adjust and look for alternatives that might offer some security in terms of personal information. There are some applications on the market like safe gallery, folder lock, and more which offers password for user messages of even user gallery but these applications still has limitations. The borrower of the phone might still check some of the personal space on the owner’s phone like phonebook and notes. Given the current need for security and privacy, researchers proposed a system that aimed to address the above issues and concerns over security of mobile phone users. It is a development from current application release from the market with features improved. This aims to heighten the security of the phone intended for guest use. Security is most needed by many devices because this enables the system to protect and manage private information. On common problems present in the Philippines, according to an article written by Bartolome (2014), it mentioned that the press release from the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP ACG), a total of 1,211 cybercrime complaints were filed to them from 2013-2015. The top five complaints received were online scams (366), online libel (240), online threats (129), identity theft (127), and photo and video voyeurism (89). This is the reason why today mobile security is important in every users, since there are 44 million users in the Philippines using smart phones said by the PNP ACG as of 2014. The users spend an average of 18.6 hours per week (around 2.6 hours per day) online. That can result to unavoidable meddling to other’s businesses. The PNP ACG also released a list of Do’s that users need to keep in mind while they are using smart phones to avoid being victimized which is to set the privacy settings to the most secure setting available and make a unique password for every information. As of today, most of the companies in the business industry, system in education, in healthcare and government even individuals are against threats for a better and safer collection of information. While having security, it is more effective when it has an encryption tool as stated by Schulz and Hoboken (2015) on the article entitled """"Human Rights and Encryption"""" is stated that encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security even it is an old technique. Until today, it is still the best protecting associate when it comes to security issues; to read an encrypted file, a user must have access to a secret key or password that enables user to decrypt it. Unencrypted data is called plain text. On the other hand, encrypted data is referred to as cipher text. However, Encrypting is a necessary process so, the risk of spreading or even losing the important file can be prevented. It is necessary to secure the multimedia files and document files of smartphones because most of people’s personal and latest multimedia files are saved on their smartphones. Aside from preventing the multimedia file to be hacked by anyone, encryption of multimedia file is also important because this assures the android user that the multimedia files and document files are secure from unauthorized viewing caused by deletion and recovery of files, sabotage, and theft. Encryption of multimedia files and document files make sure that multimedia files and document files would not easily be deleted, corrupted, modified and spreading would be prevented because only the authorized user could do these processes. It is safe from disruption because even if the encrypted file was deleted already then recovered, the file will still be encrypted. Hence, encryption of multimedia files is a direct process for android users because this secures its file and prevents unauthorized viewing caused by intentional or mostly unintentional loss of data. The researchers aim to provide more security in terms of not limiting protection commonly offered on photos and messages of the phones. Personal data will be more secured and less troublesome on the owner for guest uses.",ANONYMOUS RESTRICTION APPLICATION USING AES ALGORITHM
"Technology such as the internet are key to business, in communication, in data management and in storage. Any field that has failed to utilized technology is obsolete and outdated because it improves the efficiency in education, medicine, transportation and most importantly in law enforcement. The smartphone market has expanded from a small and limited business in some regions to a large and robust ecosystem that spans the globe. Android has emerged as the single largest smartphone platform. Android is the most widely adopted mobile platform in the world. The year 2015, it is estimated that about 83% of all smartphones shipped globally roughly 282.5 million smartphones are running a version of Android. By comparison, 47.3 million smartphones runsiOSas compared to those who use android devices. According to a study entitled """"Android Application for Crime Analysis in San Diego"""" by Gonchikara (2014), an android smartphone application that analyze location based data, it can view crime data in a region and filter crime types. It allows the users query and analyze crimes that have occurred near his location. The application includes features to measure distance between crime spots and measure area on the map. It can switch the base map to street map to NatGeo map. This study shows that application related in crime can be a modern approach in alleviating crime occurrences in our community. A large number of population in the Philippines today uses android phones. Over the years, mobile phones have changed from a simple communication device to an operative tool that has become the focal point of many businesses due to its amazing new features. The increase in advances of mobile technology, high-speed data access and the interactive interfaces have turned mobile computing into a completely new experience for users. Today these mobile apps have become an integral part of our lives and we rely on them in
more than one way. In recent years, increasing of crime is becoming serious in the Philippines. Violent crime increased for two consecutive year. While property crime decreased for the 14th straight year, as said by FBI in its annual report for the year 2016. In today's world, criminals have maximum use of all modern technologies and high-tech methods in committing crimes. Therefore, developing a good crime analysis software that can provide efficient information for the crime occurrences and quickly detect the risk level of crime in a certain area is challenging for the researcher. The level of crime also depends on the situation and varies from place to place. Crime has increasingly become as complex as human nature. While the Philippine National Police (PNP) claimed a 60% decrease in crimes in Metro Manila, the number of crimes committed nationwide increased by about 46% during the first six months of the year 2017 as compared to the same period last year.Records from the PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management (DIDM) showed that theft, car theft, physical injuries and rape were among the crimes that had a huge increase. The PNP said 885,445 crimes was reported from January to June, compared to 603,085 cases during the same period last year. Contemporary technological improvement and huge development in communication have facilitated criminals of every place at any time to spend crime in one single place to another place. PNP-DIDM records indicated that from 86,451 thefts recorded in the first six months of 2014; this ballooned to 105,229 cases this year while cases of car theft jumped to 10,039 from 5,599 last year. Murders increased from 5,004 cases to 7,245 cases this year while homicides were up to 6,607 from 4,091 last year.Cases of physical injury increased to 182,886 from 122,084 last year while rapes increased to 8,288 this year from 5,069 last year. Focusing resources on high-crime places, high-rate offenders, and repeat victims can help police effectively reduce crime in their communities. Doing it can reinforces the notion that the application of data-driven strategies, such as hotspots policing, problem-oriented policing, and intelligence-led policing, work. Police must know when, where, and how to focus limited resources, as well as how to evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies. Sound crime analysis is paramount to this success.Crime analysis cannot be effective without research.It helps lawmakers develop policies that are more effective and supports the practices of law enforcement officers. According to Tech (2014) """"Data Mining Techniques to Analyze Crime Data"""", in data mining, Crime management is an interesting application where it plays an important role in handling of crime data. Crime investigation has very significant role of police system in any country. There had been an enormous increase in the crime in recent years. With rapid popularity of the internet, crime information maintained in web is becoming increasingly rampant. In the paper, the data mining techniques are used to analyze the web data. This paper presents detailed study on classification and clustering. Classification is the process of classifying the crime type Clustering is the process of combining data object into groups. Crime Analysis is a law enforcement function that involves systematic analysis for identifying and analyzing patterns and trends in crime and disorder. Information on patterns can help law enforcement agencies deploy resources in a more effective manner, and assist detectives in identifying and apprehending suspects. Crime analysis also plays a role in devising solutions to crime problems, and formulating crime prevention strategies. Crime analysis is a deep examination of the relationships between the different criminogenic factors (e.g., time, place, socio-demographics) surrounding crime or disorder that helps us understand why it occurs. Sound crime analysis diagnoses problems so a response may be tailored to cure it, or reduce the frequency and severity of such problems. Law enforcement agencies faced a large volume of data every day. These data can be processed and transformed into useful information. Since using data mining, can be applied to greatly improve crime analysis, it can also help to reduce and prevent crime us much as possible. Crime reports and data are used as an input for the formulation of the crime prevention, policies and strategic plans. Data mining is an extension of traditional data analysis and statistical approaches in that it incorporates analytical techniques drawn from a range of disciplines. It is generally used to refer to the overall process of discovering useful knowledge from data, where data mining is a particular step in this process. It can also be the computational procedure for exploring patterns in large information sets involving practices, machine understanding, data and repository of programs. The entire goal of the data mining process is always to extract information from a data collection and convert it into an understandable framework for further use. With the use of data mining and crime analysis, it can help to assess whether the location is at risk of crime with the given datasets and attributes which includes crime types, crime location and data/time of the crime committed. Crime data mining and predictive policing solution uses big data for crime prediction and prevention of crime. In innovation in policing solution, mines law enforcement big data directly from agency’s records management systems to produce significant for crime reductions and prevention. Mapping high crime areas is not revolutionary. For decades, police forces around the country have published online maps of criminal activity for their communities, and many have integrated crowd-sourced, self-reported data. But what is revolutionary is theaccuracy and speed with which incidents can now be validated, mapped and relayed to application users. With (Global Positioning System) GPS/ (Geographic Information System) GIS, the modern law enforcement agency now has a new array of tools for combating crime and managing traffic. These new technological applications provide police officers with a wide variety of analytical capabilities and resource management information. GPS/ GIS will allow them to direct resources in a manner that is both flexible and responsive to the dynamic and volatile nature of public safety operations. Therefore,the researcher comes up with the idea of developing an application that can detect crime risk level of any place in the 16 Municipalities of 4th District of Laguna with the help of crime analysis. With the help of a data mining approach,the researcher analysed every pattern that will be produce in every process. The mobile map can help keep a person and his family to be aware of the crime in your neighborhood and when you are traveling for providing valuable information by showing the high risk places where there are abundant incidents of crime.",CRIME ANALYSIS IN 4TH DISTRICT OF LAGUNA USING JRIP ALGORITHM
"Technology has been an immense basic in today’s world. It has been utilized as a part of various viewpoints and condition. Technology refers to advancements in the methods and tools we use to solve problems or achieve a goal. Technology is widely used in different sectors in lives like in offices, homes and most especially in schools. They make it part of their everyday life and sees a chance to utilize it in each conceivable way possible. Examination is the basis of the evaluation of knowledge transfer from the teacher to the students. In the Philippines, examination is done traditionally with the use of pen and paper. As discussed by Isberto (2015) the head of Public Affairs at Smart Communication, every generation, teachers have always allotted extra effort and time needed for checking their students’ test papers. Teachers have to give a substantial amount of their time going through each test paper. He also mentioned that a teacher with a class of 40 students would need 400 minutes or a little less than seven hours to finish the task, assuming it will take him just 10 minutes to go through each test paper. Longer examinations would require longer hours for checking. He also discussed the Smart Image application developed by Capistrano et al. (2015) from Bulacan State University (BSU) on their study entitled “Image Processing based multiple-option examination checker”, that allows the hassle-free checking of test papers and it will make much easier for them to do that task, giving them more time to interact with students or bond with their families. An article discussed by Gregorio (2012) discussed that Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) is a process for the detection and recognition of marks written on paper that is often employed for the recognition of the answers checked in multiple choice tests. It is a system that analyzes digital images representing scans of multiple-choice tests compiled by students to avoid mistakes in manual process and allot of errors in counting he used Optical Mark Recognition to develop an image processing based optical mark recognition sheet scanning system. The system OMR answer sheet will be scan and the scanned image of the answer sheet will give as input to the software system. Some existing applications used Optical Mark Recognition for scanning bubble sheet type of examination. Since it is one of the most common method in having an examination it is useful that there are existing applications that can used to check those examination papers and to lessen the expensive scanners. Checking a student’s examination paper and analyzing results remain intricate and time consuming processes. An average of 95% of teachers grade their students’ tests manually and while many teachers still use separate works to grade tests, those services can take more time and effort than necessary. Unfortunately, testing and grading manually consume too much time. While every type of testing carries challenges, schools today have clearly reached the point where additional efficiency is needed. Teachers need to be able have the time to actually teach and need to find ways to do that while still dealing with severe budget challenges. Given the situation above, the researchers came up to develop a mobile application that has specific algorithm that give faster result and will not cost too much because it only used a mobile phones. This study aims to develop a mobile application that will help the teachers to lessen their work and give the examination result quickly to the students.",SMART EXAM CHECKER USING SPEED UP ROBUST FEATURE (SURF) ALGORITHM
"In the modernized world, every organization uses technology to lessen the time to make it easier for them to make a task finish easily. Students at schools are learning with the help of technology, like watching tutorials and educational films that serves the student knowledge or as a supplementary tool that can be applied in the real world especially in the field that they’re learning. The modules presented by instructors through PowerPoint presentations can make the lessons more visualized, interesting, and encouraging for the students. This can capture a student’s attention especially if it is presented with animation/videos and sound system/FX that will surely capture the attention of the students. In addition, if the students wants a broad information or idea of a certain topic, smartphones and laptops with wireless connection can connect to the internet as be used as an additional tool for learning. As technology advances, the ability of itself can make the latest innovation that can be useful and will help a lot of people in different ways. Games is one of the trends that people are still digging in, from kids to grown-ups since games offer entertainment, knowledge and challenges at the same time. People nowadays are exposed to video games that don’t give such values to its users. Video games that has maturity content is not good for them, because they may not get such moral lessons, values. Video games can also affect and may have negative side issues for people, it can affect the students in school matter especially for those students that are being addicted that may harm the physical and mental health. Not just students, but everyone who are being abusive in playing video games.
As an IT student, programming is one of the major subject that is very challenging for them. From codes and symbols/special characters to syntax that can be confusing finish a certain program. Some IT students are giving up in programming class when they can’t finish an activity or when there’s a debug that they can’t solve or find. Programming is made to challenge students and to have them get used to make a program since as an IT student, it is one of the goals to become a IT Professional. This the reason and inspiration why the researchers came up with the study to creates a role playing game entitled, “.Executor”. In “.Executor” the researchers used a twist in making a program and challenge the player’s skills in programming by playing through the game’s quests in finishing puzzles, making their weapon or armor, killing enemy, and making their way out of the game. The researchers aim to develop an educational game that is related to basic C# Programming Language for the CCS students from LSPU Sta. Cruz  to enjoy the essence of the subject while being entertained at the same time. The researchers sought to answer the following questions; (a) How to develop a role playing game that will educate the College of Computer Studies students of Laguna State Polytechnic University SCC and serve additional  learnings about Basic C# Programming Language by interacting the computer RPG? (b) How to develop a computer role playing game that will incorporate with audiovisual aid like animation/graphics and music/sound FX that will hook the attention of the user?

"Information Technology has evolved for decades, it has provided the people with ease in doing tasks and numerous advantages in this modern world. Education has been the great beneficiary of this this technological revolution. Graduates are expected to possess skills both on their field and computer competencies.

"Technology has changed the business world many times over. In the information age, the advent of computers and the Internet has increased that impact significantly. Many businesses cannot even function without the use of computer technology. This impact is seen in nearly all areas of business, including human resources, where technology continues to have a significant impact on Human Resource practices. Human Resources is one of the departments that mostly use Management Information Systems in order to disseminate information faster, execute a faster transaction and strategy to the company with the use of Human Resource Information System (HRIS). In Tiwi Food Product Company, the company’s Human Resource Department is currently using a manual method of managing and recording employees information, monitoring employees attendance and recruitment of future employees. Meanwhile the Accounting Department uses the traditional method to calculate the compensation of the regular and contractual employee. As the technology continue to innovate, Information Technology provides a solution to Human Resource Department which is Human Resource Information System (HRIS) to easily store, manage, generate, monitor and distribute information about the company and the employees. If it is used properly, employee expectations are clarified, and they are put in charge of their own development, since there is better communication and collaboration throughout the workplace. Through implementing this systems it can help to automate the processes in the company, companies may actually change the fundamental structure of the workplace and the way that daily tasks are performed.

"What would be the world looks like without technologies in it? Every year, we see how technology changed our lives. Technology means developments. As compared to the past, the manual procedure was considered a slow transaction than the computerized system it so effective to use. Albert Einstein said, “Technology has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.’’ It has become the first source of information all around the world. First, there are multiple negative effects of technology on human, but the most frightening is that it interferes on human relationships. In fact, nowadays there were less and less communication between people. They do not talk as much as they used to, and when they do, it was mostly non-verbal. One of the most challenging decision a business owner’s face nowadays is whether to continue using the manual process for business transactions or change into a computerized system. Computerized system can further be classified for those specifically created for the company, which usually cost more because of the planning, and development stages made to arrive at the best system designed specifically applicable to the business operations’ unique processes. Management Information System is a network that requires managing themselves that provides information efficient and effectively. Management system are computer systems that is used for managing five primary components which includes hardware, software, data, procedures and people including individuals, groups or organization.

"In this fast changing modern world, technology has been a huge aid in humanity. These modern technologies effortlessly made the life of the people easier to the point that they can do multiple tasks together a lot faster because of these gadgets and other functional machines. Technology is getting better in these past few years, a small, weak and “hard to use” tools turn into an innovative designed tools to lend assistance to people, not only to help them in their daily workloads but also to give them convenience in earning living and providing their daily needs. One of the significant contributions of Information Technology is the improvement of telecommunications. A few decades ago, there were no email, internet, mobile marketing, telecommuting or smart phones. Now, communications are instantaneous. Huge amount of information move through email and on the internet and powerful tools are in the hands of the people. Innovations in telecommunications progresses gave opportunities to businesses of all sizes and help turn small local businesses into global businesses. Progress in telecommunications is not limited to businesses; it also encompasses the advantages of different organizations and even personal communication. The communication nowadays is simply very easy. A user can communicate through hand-held gadgets such as tablets and smart phones. According to Chaffey, the statistics depicts the total number of smart phone users in 2016. For 2016 a number of smart phone users are forecasted to reach 2.08 billion. Currently, the modern communication makes the people rely more to technology specifically mobile and internet technology. According to Williams (2011) on his article, he mentioned that people use the Internet so much that it has made communication via the mail and even via phone a lot less common and it has consequently led to it being used less and less. The overuse of the Internet has made it convenient so that people do not have to go to retail outlets. The use of transportation other than walking and cycling has led to homes being further away from work so that people are forced to use cars or public transport. By over using technology, people can have alternative options removed from them. People use technology because it is popular, alternate methods was removed and choices were limited. All of this has led to a dependence on technology. Kiosk is a small physical structure often including a computer and a display screen provide a mobile, inexpensive means of effective information dissemination, biometric access control, training, and support for many types of customer activities including ordering, payment, and monitoring. Kiosks provide a means of extending the information system capabilities and support the needs of users who do not have access to a PC but have a need for information. At present, there two existing local kiosk technology that offers services such as electronic loading and charging machine. Garibay, Lubuguin and Palomo (2011) proposed the implementation of “E-Load Vending Machine”, this project reloads the cell phone account electronically by data transaction. Also, Xcellcomms manufactures the First Filipino Coin operated charger called I-Charj, the business is owned and operated by Eng'r. Aquilino A. Tubigan, Jr. The researchers believed that the two existing kiosk technology is insufficient and inadequate because it’s hard to find a machine that’s on the same place the combination was more convenient because it is one stop shop. Developing this project is a challenge because they are planning to develop a kiosk which is the combination of two and also going to add an extra feature which is PisoText, with a peso coin people can send a text message.",ALL-IN-ONE KIOSK
"As our world is advancing in technology through the years, every organization is also upgrading the process of how they handle and finish their specific tasks with the use of new technologies at the schools, offices, hospitals, and everywhere. But somehow, other organization are still using the manual method which people are used to, because of that, they consume a lot time to finish a single activity. Nowadays, people live in the modernized world. Modernization is now a big part of the industry, economy and even in education. One way of showing modernization is by digitalization. Digitalizing is art of converting the contents of a document from a hard copy into a machine-readable format. It makes the materials easy to access and available electronically. It also serves a purpose of preserving the materials or any type of information that can be presented in digital forms such as pictures, music works, text, computer program, databases, models and design, video programs and other works combining many types of information. A person that is in need of information can easily click, type and search for the information needed in just a matter of seconds. It does not only makes searching and information gathering easy but also it saves a lot of time and effort not only for student and teacher but for everyone who needs it. The use of learning and career portfolios in education has been in place for many years, however only recently has this moved into the digital realm. These digital e-portfolios incorporate much of the same material as the traditional paper portfolios but may often contain items such as videos, audio files, computer programs and other items that do not lend themselves well to traditional hard copy display. Portfolio is merely a collection of course projects, assignments, videotapes, and pictures designed to impress someone. If it is to meet its full potential, a portfolio must be organized, goal-driven, and performance-based evidence that indicates the attainment of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes attained by a student. This study will explain the use of e-portfolios in an educational environment to assess student’s performance, provide an electronic collection of accomplishments as well as maintain a collection of student work which can be used for accreditation purposes and to measure and assess a student’s learning outcomes. Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) helps in managing documents electronically (Minnesota Historical Society, 2012). Moreover, EDMS provides security of information while it still allows easy access of the users to the electronic document (Oakleigh Consulting Ltd, 2007). The process of EDMS has to do with capturing, storing, indexing and retrieval. It improves the access of information by the users of the organization wherein they can easily search and retrieve the documents needed. Also, there will be security in such a way that the only authorized users are allowed to access the particular documents. (ND Information Technology Department, 2014). EDMS is a software system for organizing and storing different kinds of documents. This type of system is a more particular kind of document management system, a more general type of storage system that helps users to organize and store paper or digital documents. EDMS refers more specifically to a software system that handles digital documents, rather than paper documents, although in some instances, these systems may also handle digital scanned versions of original paper documents. An electronic document management provides a way to centrally store a large volume of digital documents. Many of these systems also include features for efficient document retrieval.",ASADO: AUTOMATED STUDENT FILE AND DOCUMENT ORGANIZER
"Millennials are also referred to as Generation Y’s, are those born after 1982, they are quite a contrast from their baby boomer parents and early Generation X. (Strauss, 1993). Previous studies have explained the unique characteristics of millennial students. Millennials are the new generation of learners and the first generation to grow up with technology integrated into their lives--cellphones, i-Pads, computers, the Internet, instant messaging, texting, MySpace and Facebook accounts, computer and console video games and multimedia (Nikirk, 2009). These individuals are said to be the contributor of the future of technological advances. In addition to this, educational revolution has evolved to meet the needs of the millennial students. All of these advanced technologies greatly affects the learning process of the new generation today, and in return, their utmost potential serves as their guide and stepping stone in improving the way of living which is the key to a bright future. Game studies and mobile technologies has become a fast-growing field in research. The interest of teachers and educational scientists in innovative technology for learning and teaching has grown over the years. According to Chan & Ahern (1999), when people are intrinsically motivated to,  they  not  actually  learn more, they also tend to  have  a  more  positive experience in life. Games meet both these tests for effective learning environments: they are active experiences, and they have the capacity to  provide intrinsic motivation. Computer technology and video game environment has provided a new educational landscape injecting appropriate theoretical concepts to a more enjoyable learning experience. As new technologies enable increasingly sophisticated game experiences, the potential for the integration of games and learning becomes ever more significant. In the study conducted by Schmitz (2012) it was found out that Augmented Reality (AR) could provide valuable insight into the working mechanisms of AR learning games that may positively influence future design decisions. Augmented Reality (AR) was found in applications in educational games, introducing properties that can improve gameplay and could potentially produce unique educational affordances. Hence, AR makes games more exciting and entertaining for its users. On the other hand, The Periodic Table of Elements (PTE) is one of the most fascinating icons in Science. Scientists contributed in the development of the PTE, it was until Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev in 1869 formulated Periodic  Law  and  created  prophetic  version  of  PTE  from  57  element  in Dmitri’s time of discovery to the 118 known elements today with 700 versions. Currently, it is available in different formats, from the classic paper version to dynamic  and  interactive  online  platforms.  However,  the  translation of  this theoretical icon into a game-based learning environment has limited research undertakings. The developers constructed a game about Periodic Table of Elements (PTE) because according to Randolf (2012) to his article entitled “Book Review: Wonderful Life with the Elements”, the periodic table is our number one source of information. Scientist considers it an essential reference especially for the chemistry teachers in teaching in the field of chemistry subject.  The game is made with Augmented Reality (AR) because one of the technologies that show great potential in education especially in visualizing abstract concepts is AR.  It is a new technology that is likely to have an impact on education. (Martin, 2011). The study aimed to validate efficiency and effectiveness of the developed mobile educational game. The proponents sought to answer the following query; (a) how to conduct a pre-test and post-test to evaluate the effectiveness of the game as an educational tool; (b) how to assess the acceptability of the intended users; (c) how to evaluate the developed mobile educational game as perceived by the gamers?",AUGMENTED ELEMENT:  AN INTERACTIVE AUGMENTED REALITY GAME OF ELEMENTS

However, in the recent past there were several incidents at the school or university where laptop or gadgets of students were stolen within the school or university premises. As a result the authorities introduced a gate pass system with the intention of preventing such occurrences. Payment card acceptance provides real-time transaction authorization with an immediate guarantee from the card's issuing bank, effectively transferring transactional and credit risk to the issuing bank and away from the merchant. Automatic payment authorization via electronic payment also provides an effective control to ensure that shipment of goods is based on legitimate, secure, and timely payment. With the brisk development of e-commerce which means online business, and e-payment systems have evolved steadily in order to multiply both online as well as offline trade transactions for payment settlement. The advents of payment cards have seen a complete traversal from the conventional cash payment systems to a more secure online payment method.",AUTOMATED CANTEEN TRANSACTION AND GATE PASS MONITORING USING RFID OF ST.

"In this so-called computer age, almost all people from various ages know how to use computer. Some uses it for educational purposes, communication, online games and most especially in business and transactions. With its new invention people could easily participate in some activities, hence, believing that there are negative impact for social relationship. The point here is, technology have an important role in this century and gives many benefits for societies. Besides, technology is accessible for everyone such as teenagers, young people, adults and businessmen. Some effects also occurs for people either they could have benefits or drawback. Uses should control technology for supporting their activities and not let technology control them because technology is created merely to facilitate people’s lives. With the combined power of computers and the knowledge of a programmer, they can build a computer-based system like automating a manual system such as recording and monitoring. Monitoring is the regular observation and recording of activities taking place in a project or program. It is a process of routinely gathering information on all aspects of the project to improve a automating system effectively there are various devices that made to provide those system accurate, reliable and efficient system. A barcode reader or barcode scanner is an electronic device that can read and output printed barcodes to a computer. Using a barcode system reduces people’s time. It takes only minutes to master the hand-held scanner for reading barcodes. Furthermore, peoples do not have to gain familiarity with an entire inventory or pricing procedure. This also make their training less expensive, since they do not have to be paid for extra training time, and another people does not have to be compensated for training them. Also barcodes eliminate the possibility of human error. The occurrence of errors for manually entering data is significantly higher than that of barcodes. A barcode scanner is fast and reliable, and takes infinitely less time than entering data by hand.",CCS RESEARCH LAB MONITORING SYSTEM WITH BARCODE SCANNER
"People are always aware of the never ending evolution in technology. Devices are getting more sophisticated and advanced. End users are always following the current trend in the field of communication. Computer trends have become more powerful in this current world today. Advanced technology nowadays have helped people’s communication become easier. The current state of technology which is a visual technology has evolved for the years. It has been greatly used in businesses, education and companies. It helps in disseminating information quickly and more reliable. Various types of programmable announcement and reminder systems have been developed to disseminate information. Examples include store announcement systems which use recorded announcements to inform customers of special sale events and other promotions (in some cases by interrupting background music that is normally played over store loudspeakers), and personal reminder systems which play recorded messages to remind the user of important dates or obligations. Announcement is very important because everyone should have the knowledge about what is going to happen for them to be informed and for them to be ready. To make an announcement, they use paper and pen otherwise, they only announce verbally. To improve the way of life has always been the goal of every researcher. In harnessing the full potential of technology, this could be  achieved.  By spreading a particular information throughout a specific area or building fast and easy. We are in the era where technology in which both computers and mobile phone, has an SMS feature when utilized is a great tool in disseminating information. Traditionally, notice boards, verbal broadcast and other traditional announcement were used. Since, the college should be the one leading the university when it comes to innovation and technology, modernization in terms of updates and instant communications is really an essential. Hence, the researchers came up with the idea of latest technology and innovation, that is very beneficial not just in the field of communication, but also for educational purposes.","CCS-EBASS ""COLLEGE OF COMPUTER STUDIES - ELECTRONIC BULLETIN ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM USING SMS"""
